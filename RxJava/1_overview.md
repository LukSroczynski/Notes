# Overview

Reactive Programming - something that response to actions. Reacts when the data comes in. Another term that it's used it's  just asynchronous programming.

Let's look at the application not as CRUD with some DB. Let's look at application as a processing unit. Just take input and make some task and makes output. Makin that it doesn't care much for Data. Just processing task is important. Example of that could be twitter, you go through tweets and you don't have to remember anything (store in DB)

Reactive programming is about 4 things: 

- Elastic - how to handle load on your system. 

- Message-Driven -  

- Responsive -
