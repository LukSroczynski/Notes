Computer operates on simple switch ON / OFF

Transistor simple switch ON OFF, those works as bits (binary digit). 

A bit can have 0 or 1. 

Byte is 8 bits with representation of 2^n

| 128 | 64 | 32 | 16 | 8 | 4 | 2 | 1 |

ASCII - we can have a letter representation, after that we can store colors RGB with that we can make pictures, gifs, movies... etc.. 
so using those simple primitives we can ultimately represent all forms of media. We abstract those things so we can go from this lowest level to the highest level. This gives us this general idea of abstraction.
