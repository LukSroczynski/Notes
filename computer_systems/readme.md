# RAM memory

Stores currently running programs. 

CPU (Processor) - run all your programs on PC. It's doing all the processing.

In order for CPU to run a program, program has to exsist on RAM.

TIP: For example when you boot you PC, smartfon then operating system is taken from flash memory and puted inside of RAM. After that is 
executed by CPU.

When RAM is exceeded, when there is no room for another program that you want to run. Then we have to take something out of RAM
and put something that you want to use. That's why it's better to have more RAM because you don't have to go back to your flash drive and 
put it into RAM. Process that takes stuff in & out memory is called "Paging". 

So for example when you have a task killer or similar software on your smartfon then you just taking stuff from the 
memory-box RAM to make room for other stuff that you will run.

# CPU - Processor 

Instruction Set Architecture - list of instruction that PC understands. List contains all the things that PC can make like adding, 
multiplying etc. Processor makes simply things.

Most PC for the past decade run on x86 architecture instruction set.

Most devices like smartphones run have processors that implements ARM architecture instruction set. 

Different processors Can implement same architecture instruction set like x86. 



1. <h3> Soo What the difference between old and new processors? </h3>

> Basically they do same instruction set but newer ones do it faster. 

2. What is a computer program? 

> It's a huge list of instructions that processor can understand.

3. What is GHz means in processor? 

> Hz - is how we measure speed of the processor. Also it is a measure of freqency. Frequency is simply how often something happens in 
particular ammount of time.

> 1Hz - is one cycle per second

> 1GHz - is one bilon cycles per second 

> G - giga - 10^9
