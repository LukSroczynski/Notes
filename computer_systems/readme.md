# RAM memory

Stores currently running programs. 

CPU (Processor) - run all your programs on PC. It's doing all the processing.

In order for CPU to run a program, program has to exsist on RAM.

TIP: For example when you boot you PC, smartfon then operating system is taken from flash memory and puted inside of RAM. After that is 
executed by CPU.

When RAM is exceeded, when there is no room for another program that you want to run. Then we have to take something out of RAM
and put something that you want to use. That's why it's better to have more RAM because you don't have to go back to your flash drive and 
put it into RAM. Process that takes stuff in & out memory is called "Paging". 

So for example when you have a task killer or similar software on your smartfon then you just taking stuff from the 
memory-box RAM to make room for other stuff that you will run.
