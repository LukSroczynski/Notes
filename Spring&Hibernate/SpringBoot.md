# What we are going to Do?

- What is Spring Boot?
- Build a End to End application from scratch
- Spring Boot Features
- Configuration and Customization

Spring-Boot - is something that let's you bootstrap application from scratch. Spring makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade
Spring based applications that you can 'just run'.

> create Spring based applications - means that it's stand-alone which means that It can run on itself. Also it is production-grade which means that it's not a Hello World applications. It is something that you can deploy somewhere e.g. to production.

What is Spring?
Something that let's you build Enterprise Java Applications. Has Programming and Configuration model. Spring handle a lot of things e.g. HTTP requests, DB connection.. and more.. So Spring let's you build classes which are Simple POJO's that have annotations. Spring manages that classes and do a lot of stuff. Spring have Infrastructure support. Which is connection to DB.
What are Problems with Spring?
1. It's Huge Framework
2. Multiple setup and Configuration steps
3. Multiple build and deploy steps

Spring Boot:
- It's Opinionated - uparty, zawziÄ™ty
- Convention over Configuration
- Stand-Alone - samodzielny
- production ready - you can simply deploy that to production
