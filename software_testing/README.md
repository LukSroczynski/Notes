# Software Testing 

> Acceptability Testing - checks that requirement from contract are implemented. 

<h3> What is testing? </h3>

Basic workflow: 

- TEST INPUT <br>
- <b> Software under test </b> <br>
- TEST OUTPUT (okey OR debug) 

<h3> What is going on when we test software? </h3>

Well there is a lot of things going on. First of all when we test software we can find a bug in our application our code. That the easiest part. Same bug could be not in our code. It could be bug in specification, acceptability tests might failed. Bug might be in library that we used or with small chance in hardware that we used or complier or OS etc.
