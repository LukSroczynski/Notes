# How To Use Git / GitHub
Useful tips:
- Git it's a version control system and it works on your local PC
- GitHub is a remote server

<b><h1>List of useful commands:</h1></b>

```git
  git init <project>
```

> Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one

```git
  git add <file or .>
```

> <b> git add * </b> means add all files in the current directory, except for files, whose name begin with a dot. This is your shell > functionality, actually, Git only receives a list of files. <br>
> <b> git add . </b> though, has no special meaning in your shell, and Git add the entire directory recursively, which is basically the > same, but it also adds files whose name begin with a dot.
